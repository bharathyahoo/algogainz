## 📱 Technical Architecture

### Technology Stack

| Layer | Technology |
|-------|-----------|
| Frontend | React 18 + TypeScript + Material-UI |
| State Management | Redux Toolkit / Zustand |
| Backend | Node.js + Express |
| Database | PostgreSQL (prod) / SQLite (dev) |

| Real-time | WebSocket |
| Technical Analysis | tulip-indicators |
| Reports | ExcelJS |
| PWA | Workbox |
| AI (Optional) | OpenAI GPT-4 / OpenRouter |

### Key Design Decisions

- Manual recording option for external trades

**2. FIFO P&L Calculation**
- First In, First Out matching
- Includes all charges and taxes
- Recalculates on manual entries

**3. Real-time Updates**
- WebSocket for live prices
- 1-second alert triggers
- Minute-by-minute portfolio refresh

---

## 🎯 Success Metrics

Track these KPIs for AlgoGainz:

- ✅ Technical recommendations lead to profitable trades  
- ✅ Exit alerts trigger within 1 second
- ✅ P&L calculations are 100% accurate
- ✅ App loads in <3 seconds
- ✅ Zero security breaches
- ✅ Seamless mobile/desktop experience
- ✅ Excel reports generate correctly

---

## ⚠️ Important Considerations

### 1. App-Only Tracking
AlgoGainz **ONLY** tracks:
- ✅ Trades placed through AlgoGainz
- ✅ Manually recorded transactions

AlgoGainz **DOES NOT** track:
- ❌ Direct Zerodha Kite trades
- ❌ Trades from other apps/platforms

**Why?** This ensures accurate P&L, clear tracking, and no data conflicts.

### 2. Manual Recording
Users can manually enter:
- Buy transactions from external sources
- Sell transactions from external sources
- All charges and details
- P&L recalculates automatically

### 3. Real Money Trading
This handles real money. Requirements:
- ✅ Thorough testing before live trading
- ✅ Start with small quantities
- ✅ Clear risk disclaimers
- ✅ Proper error handling
- ✅ Audit trails for all trades

### 4. Market Hours
Live features work during:
- Trading: 9:15 AM - 3:30 PM IST
- Pre-market: 9:00 AM - 9:15 AM
- Post-market: 3:40 PM - 4:00 PM

### 5. API Rate Limits
Kite Connect has strict limits:
- Must implement caching
- Use WebSocket for real-time
- Exponential backoff for failures
